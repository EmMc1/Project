              <div><p class="lead">Welcome to Check the Weather. My name is Emma and I am a primary school teacher. I have always had an interest in technology and how it can be used in Education to benefit students learning outcomes. Last year I began a course with UCD's Professional Academy called Front End Web Development. As part of my final assignment I had to design a website incorporating all the skills I had learned over the course. </p> <p class="lead" > In thinking about what would be the focus of my website I thought about how interested my students are in places all over the world.They love learning about new places and so I  decided to create a resource for primary school students to research the weather of different cities around the world.This website provides information in three hour long blocks on the weather check page.</p> <p class="lead">On my education page I have created a resouces of a bank of ideas for teachers of activites and links using this website  that could be used to connect to other curricular areas. </p> <!--Explaining concept of website  -->

          <h2>Why weather forecasts are important</h2>  <!--What is Meteorology -->
          <p>The official name for the science of weather is Meteorology. It's the job of meteorologists to study weather patterns, and forecast (predict) weather and possible extreme weather.</p>
  
            <div class="collapse" id="extraContent1">  <!--Hidden Content -->
              <p>Weather is all around us. It's the condition of the atmosphere. From the clouds, rain and snow, to wind, thunder and sunshine, weather affects all aspects of life, so understanding the science behind it is really important. <br> Weather also includes pressure in the air, temperature and humidity.
             Weather affects all parts of daily life. Therefore, it's important that we're able to track weather patterns and predict what weather we will experience and when. For example, poor weather conditions can lead to crop damage and flooding.</p>

          <h2>How weather data is collected</h2>  <!--Weather Collection Instruments -->
          <p>Meteorologists use different weather instruments to measure and record the weather. These instruments are usually located in weather stations placed around the country. Weather instruments are also located in the sea, on planes and within satellites. <br> </p>

            <p>Weather refers to the day to day conditions and changes in the atmosphere. Climate refers to the average weather conditions of a place over a long period of time.No two places on Earth have exactly the same climate. Nevertheless, many climates are similar to one another. </p> <br>

                    Tropical climates are warm all year and have no winter. They lie near the Equator. Some tropical climates have a lot of rain while others are dry.

                    Temperate climates are found mostly north of the Equator. In these climates, cold air from the north mixes with warm tropical air from the south. This mixing often causes rain and snow. Temperate climates usually have warmer summers and colder winters.
